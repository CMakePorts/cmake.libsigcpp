	* tests/Makefile.am, tests/test_disconnect.cc:
	Add testcase with a mixed connection & disconnection sequence.

2003-02-16  Martin Schulze  <MHL.Schulze@t-online.de>

	* sigc++/signal.cc: Bugfix in signal_base::insert():
	Set notification function in the newly created copy of
	slot_ rather than in slot_ itself.

2003-02-10  Martin Schulze  <MHL.Schulze@t-online.de>

	* sigc++/signal.h.m4: Comment in typedefs for iterator types in
	the signal#<> class template. Make signal#<>::connect() return an
	iterator for convenience.
	(Note that the first change increases the binary size of
	tests/test_signal from 201k to 204k, the second change to 206k.)

	* sigc++/adaptors/lambda is disable temporarily (not built and
	not distributed) because it gets built before its parent
	directory, but #includes generated sources in the parent directory.
