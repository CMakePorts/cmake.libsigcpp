	* fragments/footer.html_fragment:
	* fragments/html_declaration.html_fragment:
	* link.shtml: Remove links to the sourceforge 
	download page, because we do not use it.

	* *.shtml: Bring the contents and links up-to-date.
	The number of links is quite reduced. Also the link to the website
	sources is non-functional; however cvs.gnome.org is work-in-progress.
